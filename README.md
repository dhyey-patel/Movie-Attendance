# Movie-Attendance

All of the code in this repository is created in R

We created this project as an assignment part of a class where we were just given a random data set on movie attendance with no additional information

The R code is commented in a comprahensive manner to walk you through the thought process when it comes to handeling the data. The goal was to find any insightful information from this survey data. 

There is a pdf which defines the questions asked in the survey

There is also a powerpoint presentation for at the end for the insights that were drawn!!
